# Memory-Hierarchy-performance-measurement
Wrote a C program running on Linux Ubuntu to access (read, write) memory in different pattern (linear &amp; random), and measure the average access time of L1, L2, L3 cache and main memory to an array. If the array can be fit into L1 cache, then the access time of the array denote that of L1 cache. It is measured using Perf and Gem5 simulator. By varying the array size, the memory mountain is plotted. Values are obtained per cache line using array of structures with the structure size equal to one cache line size. Makefile is generated to simulate all the 4 types of memory access.
